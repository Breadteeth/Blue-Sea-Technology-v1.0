 ## Design Document

### 1. Design Objectives

This project aims to design and implement a blockchain-based prototype for a cross-border e-commerce logistics platform, addressing the issues of process fragmentation, high costs, and environmental inefficiencies in East Asia to Southeast Asia logistics. Through six core modules—distributed ledger, multi-stage bidding, token economy, smart payments, API integration, and identity verification—we propose innovative solutions to optimize logistics efficiency, reduce costs, and incentivize green transportation. The design centers on a pseudo-distributed mode for rapid deployment and competition demonstration, while reserving capabilities for real distributed expansion, showcasing blockchain’s potential in logistics applications.

### 2. System Architecture

#### 2.1 Overall Architecture
The system adopts a layered architecture, divided into three layers:
- **Frontend Interaction Layer**: Built with Streamlit, it provides an intuitive web interface for demand submission, bidding management, payment tracking, and system status visualization.
- **Business Logic Layer**: Comprises multiple modules, including demand processing (`demand.py`), bidding management (`bidding.py`), payment processing (`payment.py`), token management (`tokens.py`), and visualization generation (`visuals.py`), implementing core business logic.
- **Data Storage Layer**: A pseudo-distributed ledger (`blockchain.py`) simulates multi-node collaboration, storing transaction records and states, with support for future integration with a real blockchain network.

#### 2.2 Module Relationships
- **Data Flow**: User submits demand → `demand.py` validates and records → `bidding.py` generates solutions → `payment.py` processes staged payments → `tokens.py` allocates tokens → `visuals.py` generates charts → updates `blockchain.py`.
- **Dependencies**: `main.py` serves as the entry point, coordinating modules; `api.py` provides simulated data support.

#### 2.3 Operation Modes
- **Pseudo-Distributed Mode** (default):
  - Simulates multiple nodes on a single machine using a Proof of Work (PoW) consensus, generating blocks quickly.
  - Advantages: No network setup required; a full process can be demonstrated within 5 minutes of initialization.
- **Real Distributed Mode** (optional):
  - Connects to the Ethereum Sepolia testnet via `testnet.py`, requiring RPC URL, private key, and contract address configuration.
  - Advantages: Validates real on-chain interaction potential, suitable for future expansion.

### 3. Core Module Design

#### 3.1 Distributed Ledger
- **Functional Objective**: Enable transparent sharing of logistics information, eliminating silos.
- **Design Details**:
  - **Pseudo-Distributed Implementation**:
    - Node Pool: Includes 5 virtual nodes (1 super node, 4 transport nodes), managed via a dictionary.
    - Consensus Mechanism: Simplified PoW requiring the first 4 bits of the block hash to be 0, simulating mining at ~0.5 seconds/block.
    - Data Structure: Blocks contain `index`, `timestamp`, `transactions` (list), `previous_hash`, and `hash`; transaction types include `demand`, `bid`, and `payment`.
  - **Real Distributed Reservation**:
    - Uses `web3.py` to interact with the Sepolia testnet; Solidity contracts define logistics and token operations.
- **Implementation**: `blockchain.py` initializes 41 blocks and 196 transactions; each operation (e.g., payment) adds 1 block.

#### 3.2 Decentralized Bidding
- **Functional Objective**: Reduce logistics costs through competition and generate diverse solutions.
- **Design Details**:
  - **Bidding Process**:
    1. **Initial Blind Auction**: Simulates 3 transport companies (Carrier_1 to Carrier_3) submitting independent bids based on STU and distance, randomly generated.
    2. **Secondary Optimization**: Adjusts based on carbon emissions (simulated via `api.py`), timeliness, and cost, generating three solutions:
       - Cost-Effective: Lowest price (e.g., 1100 USD).
       - Green: Lowest carbon footprint (e.g., 90.46 units).
       - Balanced: Highest composite score.
  - **Solution Evaluation**: Scoring formula: \( score = w_1 \cdot (1/price) + w_2 \cdot (1/carbon) + w_3 \cdot (1/days) \), with adjustable weights.
- **Implementation**: `bidding.py` outputs solutions; Streamlit displays tables and scatter plots; user selections are recorded to the ledger.

#### 3.3 Token Economy
- **Functional Objective**: Incentivize green transportation and ledger maintenance.
- **Design Details**:
  - **Reward Mechanism**:
    - Super Nodes: Earn 10 tokens per block generated.
    - Carbon Emission Compensation: Green solutions receive extra tokens, calculated as \( compensation = carbon_reduced \cdot 8 \) (in token units).
  - **Credit Scoring**: Based on transaction frequency and compliance, starting at 8.0, ranging from 0–10.
  - **Token Management**: Node balances stored in a dictionary, updated in real-time.
- **Implementation**: `tokens.py` records circulation increasing from 22,050.36 to 22,850.36 post-payment, with total carbon compensation at 2,231.30.

#### 3.4 Smart Payments
- **Functional Objective**: Enable efficient linkage between payments and logistics milestones.
- **Design Details**:
  - **Payment Stages**:
    - Warehouse: 30% (e.g., 330 USD).
    - Customs: 40% (e.g., 440 USD).
    - Transport: 20% (e.g., 220 USD).
    - Delivery: 10% (e.g., 110 USD).
  - **Trigger Mechanism**: Users manually click “Next Stage Payment” to simulate logistics progress (synced via `api.py`).
  - **Compliance Check**: Calls `verify_compliance` to validate node identity and amount.
- **Implementation**: `payment.py` generates orders (e.g., `pay_4c89034d`); each payment records a new block.

#### 3.5 API Integration
- **Functional Objective**: Simulate external data support to ensure functional completeness.
- **Design Details**:
  - **Simulated Interfaces**:
    - `calculate_distance`: Returns distance from origin to destination (e.g., Shanghai to Singapore, 4,480 km).
    - `verify_compliance`: Returns a boolean based on credit score and amount.
    - `carbon_footprint`: Randomly generates emissions based on transport type and distance (e.g., 90.46 units).
  - **Future Expansion**: Supports real APIs (e.g., Google Maps, carbon emission databases).
- **Implementation**: `api.py` provides random yet reasonable simulated data, integrated into all modules.

#### 3.6 Identity Verification with CLP
- **Functional Objective**: Ensure transaction authenticity and compliance.
- **Design Details**:
  - **CLP Verification**:
    - Conditions: Total weight ≤ 28,000 kg, total volume ≤ 67.7 m³, compliant if no hazardous materials.
    - Signature Generation: Computes SHA-256 hash of the CLP JSON string.
  - **Scalability**: Supports future ECDSA signatures or DID integration.
- **Implementation**: `_validate_clp` in `demand.py` verifies input; `_generate_clp_signature` generates the signature.

### 4. System Workflow

#### 4.1 Complete Workflow
1. **Demand Submission**:
   - Input: 1,000 kg, 5 m³, Shanghai to Singapore, CLP list.
   - Processing: Calculates STU (1.67), validates CLP, generates demand ID, records to ledger.
2. **Bidding Generation**:
   - Simulates initial blind auction (3 bids), optimizes to generate three solutions.
   - User selects a solution (e.g., cost-effective).
3. **Payment Execution**:
   - Creates an order, processes payments in 4 stages, updating status and tokens each time.
4. **Status Display**:
   - Updates block count (56), transaction count (242), circulation (22,850.36), and generates charts.

#### 4.2 Data Structure Examples
- **Demand**: `{"id": "abc123", "weight": 1000, "volume": 5, "stu": 1.67, "clp_signature": "sha256_hash"}`
- **Solution**: `{"carrier_id": "Carrier_1", "price": 1100, "carbon": 90.46, "days": 7}`
- **Payment**: `{"id": "pay_4c89034d", "stage": "delivery", "amount": 110}`
